# GitHub Issues Workflow
- ALWAYS check for open issues at the start of a session using `gh issue list`.
- All work MUST be tracked via a GitHub issue.
- If the user asks for something new, create an issue for it first using `gh issue create`.
- **CRITICAL: ALWAYS create a new branch for the issue before starting work.**
  - Format: `issue/[number]-[short-description]` (e.g., `issue/1-chatbot-visibility`)
  - NEVER commit directly to `main` for issue work.
- When working on an issue, use `gh issue comment [number] --body "..."` to log progress.
- When completing a task, close the issue using `gh issue close [number]`.
- Merge the branch back to `main` only after verification.
- Always prefix commit messages with the issue number (e.g., "#1: Add feature...").

## Context Gathering (New Sessions)
- **If you are in a new session and lack sufficient context about the codebase or the issue you are about to work on**, you MUST run the `/context-gathering` workflow (`.agent/workflows/context-gathering.md`) before proceeding.
- Sufficient context means you understand:
  - The project structure (key directories, services, and UI files).
  - The specific issue requirements (from `gh issue view`).
  - Relevant code areas related to the issue.
- If any of the above is unclear, run the context-gathering workflow.

## General
- Use the `gh` CLI for all GitHub interactions.
- Keep `task.md` in sync with GitHub issues.
- Always read `.agent/workflows/issues.md` if managing issues.
