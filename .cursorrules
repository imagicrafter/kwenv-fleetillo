# GitHub Issues Workflow

All work MUST be tracked via GitHub issues. Follow `.agent/workflows/context-gathering.md` for the complete workflow.

## Quick Rules
- **Start of session**: `gh issue list` to check open issues
- **New work**: Create issue first with `gh issue create`
- **Before coding**: Create branch `issue/[N]-[description]` - NEVER commit to `main`
- **During work**: Log progress with `gh issue comment [N] --body "..."`
- **Commits**: Prefix with issue number (e.g., `#1: Add feature...`)
- **Completion**: Merge to main, close issue, update CHANGELOG

## New Sessions
If you lack context about the codebase or issue, follow the **Issue Workflow** in `.agent/workflows/context-gathering.md`. This covers:
- Phase 1: Issue selection & branch setup
- Phase 2: Context gathering
- Phase 3: Implementation planning
- Phase 4: Execution
- Phase 5: Completion

**Ask clarifying questions** if the issue lacks sufficient detail.

## Planning (Complex Issues)
- **Claude Code CLI**: Use plan mode - plans auto-save to `.claude/plans/` and post to GitHub issues
- **Other AI tools**: Manually create `.claude/plans/issue-N-plan.md` and post with `gh issue comment`
- Plans are archived to `.claude/plans/archive/` with timestamps
- External reviews (Gemini/Codex CLI) also post to issues if available
- Search past plans: `grep -r "keyword" .claude/plans/archive/`

## Tool Consistency
All AI tools (Claude Code CLI, Google Antigravity, Cursor, etc.) should:
- Store plans in `.claude/plans/`
- Use branch format `issue/N-description`
- Commit with `#N:` prefix
- Log progress via `gh issue comment`
