{"body":"The web-launcher frontend currently relies heavily on `window.electronAPI` for data fetching and operations. Since the Electron launcher is being deprecated, we need to decouple the frontend from this dependency and standardize on a web-based API client.\n\n**Scope of Work:**\n\n1.  **Create a Unified API Client:** Develop a `api-client.js` (or extend `dispatch-client.js`) that abstracts API calls. It should handle the logic of calling the backend API (likely via the existing `/api/rpc` endpoint or REST endpoints) without relying on injected Electron globals.\n2.  **Refactor Frontend Pages:** Systematically update all HTML/JS files to use this new API client instead of `window.electronAPI`. Affected files include:\n    *   `customers.html`\n    *   `services.html`\n    *   `settings.html`\n    *   `locations.html`\n    *   `vehicles.html`\n    *   `bookings.html`\n    *   `drivers.html`\n    *   `routes.html`\n    *   `dispatch.html` (cleanup existing fallback logic)\n3.  **Cleanup:** Remove Electron-specific preload scripts, IPC handlers, and conditional logic checks for `window.electronAPI`.\n\n**Goal:** Ensure the entire web-launcher functions correctly as a standard web application running in a browser.","number":21,"title":"Refactor Frontend to Remove Electron Dependency"}
