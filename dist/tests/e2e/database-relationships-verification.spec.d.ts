/**
 * Database Relationships and Foreign Key Constraints Verification Test
 *
 * This test verifies that all foreign key constraints and referential integrity
 * rules are properly enforced in the RouteIQ database.
 *
 * Tests cover:
 * 1. Foreign key constraints (bookings, maintenance_schedules, routes)
 * 2. Cascade behaviors (RESTRICT, CASCADE, SET NULL)
 * 3. Validation triggers (routes.stop_sequence)
 * 4. Helper functions (can_delete_booking, get_routes_for_booking)
