I'll help you implement this database schema migration from `public` to `routeiq`. This is a significant change that requires careful planning and exploration of the codebase.

Let me start by entering plan mode to thoroughly explore the codebase and design the implementation approach.

🔧 Tool: EnterPlanMode
Input: {}

I need your approval to enter plan mode. This will allow me to:
1. Thoroughly explore the database configuration and usage throughout the codebase
2. Identify all places where schema changes are needed
3. Design a comprehensive implementation approach
4. Present a plan for your approval before making changes

This is important because schema migration can affect many parts of the application and we want to ensure we don't miss anything. Should I proceed with plan mode?
