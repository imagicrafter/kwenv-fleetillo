  <overview>
    RouteIQ is a route planning application designed for service-based businesses to efficiently manage their daily operations. The application maintains a comprehensive client database with service addresses, manages a catalog of services with average service times, and provides a sophisticated booking scheduler for both one-time and recurring services. The system tracks a fleet of service vehicles, each tagged with their supported service types and maintenance schedules. The core feature is a route planning engine that generates optimized daily route plans by combining service schedules and vehicle availability, leveraging Google Routes API for optimization. The application also provides address validation functionality powered by Google Maps API. This prototype focuses on building a production-quality user interface using Node.js and TypeScript, while integrating with existing server-side route planning and address verification capabilities. The prototype will be locally hosted without user management features.
